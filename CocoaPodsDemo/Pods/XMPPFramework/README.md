An XMPP Framework in Objective-C for the Mac and iOS development community.

### Abstract
XMPPFramework provides a core implementation of RFC-3920 (the XMPP standard), along with the tools needed to read & write XML. It comes with multiple popular extensions (XEP's), all built atop a modular architecture, allowing you to plug-in any code needed for the job. Additionally the framework is massively parallel and thread-safe. Structured using GCD, this framework performs well regardless of whether it's being run on an old iPhone, or on a 12-core Mac Pro. (And it won't block the main thread... at all)

### Install

The minimum deployment target is iOS 8.0 / macOS 10.9 / tvOS 9.0.

#### CocoaPods

The easiest way to install XMPPFramework is using CocoaPods. Remember to add to the top of your `Podfile` the `use_frameworks!` line (even if you are not using swift):

This will install the whole framework with all the available extensions:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'XMPPFramework', '~> 3.7.0'
```

After `pod install` open the `.xcworkspace` and import:

```
import XMPPFramework      // swift
@import XMPPFramework;   //objective-c
```

#### Carthage

To integrate XMPPFramework into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Carthage support is currently experimental ‚ö†Ô∏è
# For now, use the master branch until a Carthage-compatible
# tagged release is available.

github "robbiehanson/XMPPFramework" "master"

```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `XMPPFramework.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! If you are planning a larger feature, please open an issue first for community input. Please use modern Objective-C syntax, including nullability annotations and generics. Here's some tips to make the process go more smoothly:

* Make sure to add any new files to the iOS, macOS, and tvOS targets for `XMPPFramework.framework` in `XMPPFramework.xcodeproj`, and ensure any applicable header files are set to public.
* Please try to write your code in a way that's testable. Using `XMPPMockStream` makes testing pretty easy. Look at examples in `Testing-Shared` for inspiration.
* You will need both CocoaPods and Carthage to work on tests. Run `carthage checkout` in the root of the repository, and `bundle install && bundle exec pod install` in the `Testing-iOS` and `Testing-macOS` folders.
* Create your test files to the `Testing-Shared` folder, and then add them to the iOS, macOS, and tvOS targets in `Testing-Carthage/XMPPFrameworkTests.xcodeproj`, `Testing-macOS/XMPPFrameworkTests.xcworkspace` and `Testing-iOS/XMPPFrameworkTests.xcworkspace`.

Looking to help but don't know where to start? 

* A large portion of the framework is not yet annotated for nullability and generics. 
* Adding more test coverage is always appreciated
* Modernizing the old Examples projects

#### Security Issues

If you find a security problem, please do not open a public issue on GitHub. Instead, email one of the maintainers directly:
